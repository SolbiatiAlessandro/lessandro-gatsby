- 6 gigaton per year by 2050
- Those solutions by themselves won't scale to the size of the problem
- Carbon removal is behind only 10k removed 
- IPCC 2018 made people realise we need CDR

## [Carbon] Carbon Removal w/ Lower Carbon Capital
- DAC HUBS $3.5B for 4 hubs of carbon removal in US https://www.energy.gov/bil/four-regional-clean-direct-air-capture-hubs
- + IRA 44 qtax credit , 180$/ton 130$/ton utilisiation
- Anthony Cottone, 1PointFive and Oxy (oil and gas!)
- We are not waiting for grants
- 71M direct air capture facilities
- Get revenue when you sequestrate CO2e
- Hub in west texas
- "We are going to need oil and gas for a long time"
- Clea Kolster
- LCC fund entirely dedicated to carbon capture $350M  
- Traditional and new stuff Biomass conversion 
- Raise that fund cause we realised there is already market 
- Purchasing carbon removal credit from private sector entities
- There is a market already
- Private companies, majority of 100 large companies in the world have some form of net zero goals that are going to require net zero removal plans
- Fundantionally our funds doesn't rely on gov grant, but incentives 
- Carbon removal market is existing and growing to a place $100B in next 10 20 ys
- Not all companies in portfolio benefitting from DAC hub
- $3.5B for DAC hub is great
- Clea has been working on carbon removal on carbon capture before it was cool
- Today you have 100s of companies that are working on CDR
- We need to scale by 1Mx 
- Brightest mind on the world want to go work on this, proud of this
- Private sector money going into this
- Inherentily assumes that CDR is going to be part of their carbon sect 
- New tech really important because incumbent tech (direct air capture) we are talking about doubling are total global electricity demand
- Tax credit for CDR, definition rather narrow and reduce minimum facility size by a thousand 
- It also requires lots of financial insurance that small startups can't do 
- Challenge around permiting of …. 3-6 years process
- You need to lobby for it or wait years, so not viable for startups
- Risks between companies?
- No, climate tech space and CDR in particular is one of th emost collaborative we see in the industry
- Most groups look to be collaborative cause they want to be collaborative 
- Celina Scott Buechler @cleobu, Data for Progress https://www.dataforprogress.org/
- How do we make sure DAC hubs are space for CDR innovation specificically
- CDR how to ebate emissions
- 2050 onwards we need to be net negative
- Initial $3.5B they are centering communities that is not shifting a mission around on a ledgerbook but is actually net negative
- Eventually compensate for the enormous carbon debt that we owe the world
- Other countries need that extra room 
- DAC Hubs represent is the first real opportunity for large government that has carbon debt to the world to do things right and monitor where carbon is stored in a way that is equitable
- DOE has put great thought into it
- Ideal outcomes for DAC hubs?
- Funding oportunity announcemnt will defined who benefit, right now still unclear
- Community benefit plan, engaging community around the site you might choose for DAC hub 
- Currently we just have "Notice of intent" we need to see what comes out
- Lots of excitement for small scale company at the stage where they are development tech where they are able to switch things around when stuff come sout
- Quote "we are going to grow oil and gas drilling in such a way that is carbon neutral" (???)
- CDR is laughed out of the room in DC
- How can Oxy start divesting funding of expansion of oil and gas
- Petronova: 90% capture inefficiency but 7% carbon reduction, https://www.nrg.com/case-studies/petra-nova.html

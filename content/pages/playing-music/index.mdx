Growing up I thought I would play piano as a profession. Things ended up differently, but I kept exploring different styles and instruments over the year.

### Classical Piano 

I spent the first ten years of my musical career with a standard classical piano education, since the age of 8.

This recording  is from the Yamaha Asia Music Scholarship 2017 competition held in Shanghai, where I got a second place.

Some of my other public recordings include
- [Liszt's Liebestraum No. 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isHg7HIr8iE)
- [Chopin â€“ Fantaisie-Impromptu, Op. 66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHUGcYSRpCg)

### Jazz Piano

At 16 I turned to jazz studying under Aldo Radaelli, a local jazz player from Milano.

My style follows the classic jazz from the 1950's, with my references being [Bill Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans) and [Miles Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis). 

I also recorded some [duos with the drummer Mario Solbiati](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVyHBiUyf6w), also my grandfather.

### Violin

I couldn't always bring a piano along with me, so I bought a violin and started studying.

You can also watch me [playing violin on the street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQTD2dyyFoE), cause why should I do my violin exercise at home when I can do them *en plein air*.

### Drums

My current company has a music room with drums so after 6 months there I picked up jazz drumming pretty eagerly.

So far drums is the instruments I enjoy playing the most, strongly recommended!

### Classical Guitar

None of the previous instruments shines for apartment accessibility, so during the COVID-19 lockdown I bought a guitar and started playing classical pieces.

Most surprising fact is that guitar hurts your fingers pretty bad, and every guitarist went through a painful process of forming calli on their fingers.

### Experimenting

Most recently I am experimenting in joining musical instruments and computational instruments, two areas that fascinate me but are rarely intersected.

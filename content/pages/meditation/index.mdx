There is not much to say about meditation. I will leave just a picture taken [here](https://ditu.baidu.com/search/%E5%B7%A8%E9%B9%BF%E8%B7%AF168%E5%8F%B7/@13522190.08,3640173.79,21z,87t,-89.4h?querytype=s&da_src=shareurl&wd=%E5%B7%A8%E9%B9%BF%E8%B7%AF168%E5%8F%B7&c=289&src=0&pn=0&sug=0&l=19&b=(13519975.28667057,3638195.8618302206;13520799.25508717,3638645.120800225)&from=webmap&biz_forward=%7B%22scaler%22:1,%22styles%22:%22pl%22%7D&device_ratio=1#panoid=09000300121905201328488967I&panotype=street&heading=349.76&pitch=-13.7&l=21&tn=B_NORMAL_MAP&sc=0&newmap=1&shareurl=1&pid=09000300121905201328488967I) in 2018

and a quote from [Eckhart Tolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Now)

>  A beggar had been sitting by the side of a road for over thirty years. One day a stranger walked by. "Spare some change?" mumbled the beggar, mechanically holding out his old baseball cap. "I have nothing to give you," said the stranger. Then he asked: "What's that you are sitting on?" "Nothing," replied the beggar. "Just an old box. I have been sitting on it for as long as I can remember." "Ever looked inside?" asked the stranger. "No," said the beggar. "What's the point? There's nothing in there." "Have a look inside," insisted the stranger. The beggar managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with gold.

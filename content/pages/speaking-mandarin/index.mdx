Speaking mandarin is easier than most people think

I was fluent after three year of studying mandarin ([HSK5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi)), whereas for English took me around 8 years. 

Watch this [not-so-serious interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mwgx83KGWY) I gave at a local television while I was in Shanghai.

Also there is a surprisingly low amount of non-asian people who are fluent in mandarin: that's why my market value as a foreginer skyrocketed while I was in China.

The image above is me when I ended up as a TV Host presenting entirely in Mandarin in front of 10.000 Chinese people.

Fun times!
